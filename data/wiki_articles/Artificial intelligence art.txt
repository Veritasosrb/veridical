Artificial intelligence Art refers to any artwork created through the use of artificial intelligence. 


== Tools and processes ==
There are many mechanisms for creating AI art, including procedural 'rule-based' generation of images using mathematical patterns, algorithms which simulate brush strokes and other painted effects, and artificial intelligence or deep learning algorithms such as generative adversarial networks and transformers.
One of the first significant AI art systems is AARON, developed by Harold Cohen beginning in the late 1960s.Since their design in 2014, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are often used by AI artists. This system uses a "generator" to create new images and a "discriminator" to decide which created images are considered successful.DeepDream, released by Google in 2015, is one of the more well-known AI art tools. DeepDream uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic pareidolia, thus creating a dream-like psychedelic appearance in the deliberately over-processed images.OpenAI released a series of images in January 2021 created using one of its algorithms "DALL-E". The program can use AI to generate a variety of drawings and pictures based on various text prompts.


== Sales ==
An auction sale of artificial intelligence art was held at Christie's Auction House in New York in 2018, where the AI artwork Edmond de Belamy sold for $432,500, which was almost 45 times higher than its estimate of $7,000-$10,000. The artwork was created by "Obvious", a Paris-based collective.

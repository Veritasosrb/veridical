Emmabuntüs is a Linux distribution derived from Ubuntu/Debian and designed to facilitate the repacking of computers donated to humanitarian organizations like the Emmaüs Communities.The name Emmabuntüs is a portmanteau of Emmaüs and Ubuntu.


== Features ==
This Linux distribution can be installed, in its entirety, without an Internet connection as all of the required packages are included within the disk image. The disk image includes packages for multiple languages and also optional non-free codecs that the user can choose whether to install or not.
One gigabyte of RAM is required for the distribution.
An installation script automatically performs some installation steps (user name, password predefined). The script allows you to choose whether or not to install non-free software, whether to uninstall unused languages to reduce updates.
Emmabuntüs includes browser plug-ins for data privacy.
There are three docks to choose from to simplify access to the software and are defined by the type of user (children, beginners and "all").


== Desktop environment ==
The desktop environment is Xfce with Cairo-Dock. LXDE is also included and can be optionally installed.

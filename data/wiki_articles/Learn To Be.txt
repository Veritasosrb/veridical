Learn To Be is a U.S. non-profit organization that recruits volunteers to offer free online tutoring to students in underserved communities.
In February 2011, the Learn To Be Foundation was featured on Philanthroper.com, a website that features a different non-profit every day to encourage philanthropy as a daily habit. By this time, Learn To Be has already offered 4000 hours of tutoring to more than 5000 students.


== Service ==
Learn To Be provides tutoring through a customized online classroom environment that has been open-sourced by BigBlueButton. Similar services include Tutor.com, which provides free tutoring to military families, and TutorChatLive, a non-profit founded by students from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
The tutors apply via an online form on the Foundation's website, and after a certification process and background check, are allowed to enter the community to pick up sessions. The Foundation and its University Chapters approach low-performing schools and schools in generally underserved areas, where students can gain access to the Learn To Be tutoring platform at a school computer lab or on a library computer. Students can request sessions in math, sciences, and language arts between 9am and 9pm, Pacific Time. The service is completely free and is supported by the Foundation which operates solely on donations from the community.
In addition, online tutoring providers like Learn To Be assist homeschooled children with their academics. For example, Learn To Be is featured as a free homeschooling resource by Galileo Education, an academic support service run by Christa Novelli.

Agent architecture in computer science is a blueprint for software agents and intelligent control systems, depicting the arrangement of components. The architectures implemented by intelligent agents are referred to as cognitive architectures. The term agent is a conceptual idea, but not defined precisely. It consists of facts, set of goals and sometimes a plan library.

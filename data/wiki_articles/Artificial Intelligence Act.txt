The Artificial Intelligence Act is a proposed regulation by the European Commission which aims to introduce a common regulatory and legal framework for artificial intelligence. It applies to all sectors (except for military), and to all types of artificial intelligence.
The proposed regulation classifies artificial intelligence applications by their risk, and regulates them according to their risk. Low-risk applications are not regulated at all, self-assessment by the application provider is, however, encouraged. Medium and high-risk systems would require compulsory self-assessment before put on the market, and some especially critical applications (for example in the medical sector) would require an independent assessment by third parties.
The proposal also would put a ban on certain types of applications, namely biometric mass surveillance, applications that subliminally manipulate persons, applications that exploit vulnerabilities of certain groups in a harmful way, and social credit scoring. For the first three, some limited exceptions in the context of law-enforcement exist, but social scoring would be banned completely.The act also proposes the introduction of a European Artificial Intelligence Board which will encourage national cooperation and ensure that the regulation is respected.

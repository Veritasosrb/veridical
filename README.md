## INTRODUCTION
Using bug tracking tools, organizations can manage test reports more efficiently and deliver high quality products with reduced development costs and higher customer satisfaction. It is common for all testers to encounter the same bug, resulting in duplicate bugs being reported in the system. These duplicate bugs can be solved if common code files are handled properly.In light of this, duplicate bug report detection is a critical process that can significantly improve development quality and
efficiency. It also helps organizations provide their customers with better services.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Developers rely on bug reports to fix bugs. Typically, bug reports are stored and managed via bug tracking software. There is a high possibility that many testers
may encounter same bug as a result of which bug tracking systems may contains many duplicate bug reports. Thus implement a tool for effective detection of duplicate bug reports so as to reduce time and cost of operation and human resources.

### LIBRARIES USED

#### NLTK 
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a text processing library that is widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It supports the high-performance functions of tokenization, parsing, classification, etc. The NLTK team initially released it in 2001 (Nltk.org, 2018). 

#### Scikit-learn 
Scikit-learn is a machine learning library in Python. It performs easy-to-use dimensional reduction methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), clustering methods such as k- 10 means, regression algorithms such as logistic regression, and classification algorithms such as random forests (Scikit-learn.org, 2018). 

#### Pandas 
Pandas provides a flexible platform for handling data in a data frame. It contains many open-source data analysis tools written in Python, such as the methods to check missing data, merge data frames, and reshape data structure, etc. (“Pandas”, n.d.). 

#### Gensim 
Gensim is a Python library that achieves the topic modeling. It can process a raw text data and discover the semantic structure of input text data by using some efficient algorithms, such as Tf-Idf and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Rehurek, 2009). 

#### Flask 
Flask, issued in mid-2010 and developed by Armin Ronacher, is a robust web framework for Python. Flask provides libraries and tools to build primarily simple and small web applications with one or two functions (Das., 2017). 

#### Bootstrap 
Bootstrap is an open-source JavaScript and CSS framework that can be used as a basis to develop web applications. Bootstrap has a collection of CSS classes that can be directly used to create effects and actions for web elements. Twitter’s team developed it in 2011 (“Introduction”, n.d.).
